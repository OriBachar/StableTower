Routine in O(n^2) that receives as input three sets: Length, Width and Height 
The dimensions of the box i (1≤i≤n) are: Length [i] x Width [i] x Height [i].
On the routine shows the stable tower with a maximum height and return its rate.
A tower will be stable if for every box i above box j there is Length[i] < Length[j] and also Width[i] < Width[j].
